            <h2 id="week-1">Week 1 - Failing to make a physics engine</h2>
            <p>This was my first time using Haxe, and my first time using an object-oriented language besides C#/Java/C++, so it was pretty disorienting at first. I wasted the first few days on making an entity-based physics engine when my game didn&#39;t need an entity-based physics engine. I removed that feature by the sixth day.

            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don&#39;t make features you don&#39;t need when under a time constraint.</p>
            <p>I spent the rest of the week exploring LDtk and making stupid dependency mistakes. By the end of the first week, I had pretty much nothing besides a simple (copy-paste) LDtk renderer and a controllable cube. The future looked bleak.

            <h2 id="week-2">Week 2 - Actually making a physics engine</h2>
            <p>After removing most of the physics code from the previous week, I&#39;ve began working on implementing tilemap-based physics &amp; collisions. It took me most of the week to get that working, and it had a ton of bugs (there&#39;s actually a bug with knockback in the final release, but I made sure the enemies can&#39;t trigger it anymore. It was very annoying).

            <p>Besides the physics stuff, I&#39;ve begun working on animations &amp; gameplay that week. I&#39;ve added the snail enemies (which didn&#39;t do anything yet at that point) during the last day.

            <h2 id="week-3">Week 3 - Adding basic gameplay</h2>
            <p>During this week, I&#39;ve added most of the mechanics of the final game, like the spellcasting logic and all Fire spells, taking damage and multiplayer.

            </p>
            <p>It was a very productive week, and allowed me to add basically everything else relatively easily, but I didn&#39;t think that at the time, and thought that I&#39;ll have to really tone down my vision - especially since I hadn&#39;t programmed the teleport spell yet.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don&#39;t panic.

# Project Climb Post-mortem
<br>
## Intro
Project Climb was a challenge I've set for myself: make a complete game, from scratch, using a new language & framework, in one month. A complete history of my thoughts during the challenge is available on my [log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GurLad/ProjectClimb/main/log.txt): this post-mortem is basically a summary of it with videos.

## Week 1 - Failing to make a physics engine
This was my first time using Haxe, and my first time using an object-oriented language besides C#/Java/C++, so it was pretty disorienting at first. I wasted the first few days on making an entity-based physics engine when my game didn't need an entity-based physics engine. I removed that feature by the sixth day.
// Video of the 4th day

**Tip:** Don't make features you don't need when under a time constraint.

I spent the rest of the week exploring LDtk and making stupid dependency mistakes. By the end of the first week, I had pretty much nothing besides a simple (copy-paste) LDtk renderer and a controllable cube. The future looked bleak.

## Week 2 - Actually making a physics engine
After removing most of the physics code from the previous week, I've began working on implementing tilemap-based physics & collisions. It took me most of the week to get that working, and it had a ton of bugs (there's actually a bug with knockback in the final release, but I made sure the enemies can't trigger it anymore. It was very annoying).
// Video of the 10th day

**Tip:** Don't make physics engines unless you hate yourself.

Besides the physics stuff, I've begun working on animations & gameplay that week. I've added the snail enemies (which didn't do anything yet at that point) during the last day.

## Week 3 - Adding basic gameplay
During this week, I've added most of the mechanics of the final game, like the spellcasting logic and all Fire spells, taking damage and multiplayer.
// Video of the 18th day

It was a very productive week, and allowed me to add basically everything else relatively easily, but I didn't think that at the time, and thought that I'll have to really tone down my vision - especially since I hadn't programmed the teleport spell yet.

**Tip:** Don't panic.

## Week 4 - Speedrun time
During this week, I tried my best to add as many features as possible in as little time as possible. This was also the first time I started really hard-coding stuff, but it paid off.
// Video of the 24th day

While making the UI, I thought of adding a Kirby style, always present boss health indicator to force me to make a boss. It worked. In the last four days, I worked on Project Climb a bit too much, neglecting my university homework, to add things like keybindings, four spells and a boss.

**Tip:** Don't neglect university homework. It doesn't end well.

## Conclusion
It was definitely an interesting challenge, and I'm very happy with the end result - I think Project Climb is one the best games I've ever made, even without content. I've also learned a lot from this. Anyway, now I'm back at working on [Frogman Gaiden](https://github.com/GurLad/FrogmanGaiden), so I'll have to leave Project Climb. For now.
