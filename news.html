                We will add a more detailed update about our current game in a few weeks.

            Since the release of Gravity Banana many things happened, but we wanted to publish it only when we have a new game ready. However, it has been almost a year since the release of Gravity Banana, so we decided to tell you a bit about what happened lately:
            <br />
            +We found a new 3D graphics maker so we can continue working.
            <br />
            +We started many games but because of technical problems they were delayed, and that's why there wasn't any new game lately.
            <br />
            +Two team members who didn&#39;t really do anything left.
            <br />
            +We now work on the first game in our main series, which tells about the lab that created Gravity Banana.
            <br />
            +We will also release a remastered version of Gravity Banana in Unity after this game so all the games in the series will be in the same engine.

            We have decided to move to Unity to make our next game. We started making it, but our 3D graphics maker stopped making graphics, so we would like to find a new one. We don&#39;t have many demands, as long as you know how to make 3D graphics, animations and cutscenes for Unity. If you answer those things and want to work with us, please contact us at disc.o.key.devteam@gmail.com. If you aren&#39;t sure, we would be happy to send you the corrent version of our next game, to see if you would like to work on it or not, but keep in mind this is an early version and can be very buggy.
